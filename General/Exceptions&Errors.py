# Error can be a syntax error or an exception
# Most common builtin exceptions
# How can we raise and handle exceptions?
# How can we defien our own exceptions

# Even when a statement is syntactically correct, it may raise an
# Error when it is executed -> This is called an exception error;

# There are several error classes
"""Ex: 1. Type error
       2. import error
       3. name error
       4. FileNotFoundError
       5. ValueError
       6. IndexError
       7. KeyError
...etc"""

# We can catch exceptions with a "try and except block"...
"""Both exceptions and errors are sub-classes of a throwable class.
Exceptions occur during runtime and compile time."""
"""Exceptions can be handled during runtime whereas errors can not
